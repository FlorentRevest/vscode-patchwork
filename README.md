# VSCode - Patchwork

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")
 
This extension integrates VSCode with [Patchwork](http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/). It supports:

* Searching and navigating patch series
* Viewing patches with two panes diffs
* Applying series or patches locally
* Reading mail replies
* Replying to emails directly from the IDE (using git send-email)

The extension is set to use patchwork.kernel.org by default. You can change this to your preferred Patchwork instance in the extension's settings. Look for `patchwork.baseUrl`.
